**VLSI Physical Design for ASICs**

**Objective**

The objective of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) physical design for ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) is to transform a logical design description (RTL - Register Transfer Level) into a physical layout that can be fabricated as an integrated circuit. This involves translating the high-level functional representation of the circuit into a physical implementation that meets design constraints, performance targets, and manufacturability requirements.

**Introduction**



**ISA (Instruction Set Archhitecture)**




    ISA defines the interface between a computer's hardware and its software, specifically how the processor and its components interact with the software instructions that drive the execution of tasks.
    It encompasses a set of instructions, addressing modes, data types, registers, memory organization, and the mechanisms for executing and managing instructions.




**RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing - Five)**



    It is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that has gained significant attention and adoption in the world of computer architecture and semiconductor design.
    RISC architectures simplify the instruction set by focusing on a smaller set of instructions, each of which can be executed in a single clock cycle. This approach usually leads to faster execution of individual instructions.
